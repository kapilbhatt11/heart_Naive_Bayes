with heart data set i have done exploratory data analysis.

making some distplot and some bar plots.

with "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split", dividing data into train and test set.

with "from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB", donig naive bayes analysis.

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, try wo finding accuracy.

same thing is done with Gaussian Naive Bayes.
